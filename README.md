Course contents block
=====================

Course contents block produces a list of all visible topic/week in the course.
Clicking at one of these links will display that particular week or topic.

The block automatically extracts a suitable title for every week or topic from
the section summary. If you start summary with a heading (H1, H2, H3, etc), it
will use such heading text. If your summary starts with a bold text, it will be
used as a section title. If the summary consists of several paragraphs, the
first one will be used. If the summary is empty, a customizable text "Unit X"
(where X is the number) is displayed. Technically spoken, the plain text
content of the first non-empty HTML DOM node from the section summary is used
as the summary title.

This block requires PHP 5.
